Modifications by RJ Tidey to preview page
Instead of a list of the captured filenames they are parsed into a table
making it a little clearer and allowing more rapid delete of individual files.
Images recorded are displayed as thumbnails.

Videos recorded after motion detection can also have a thumbnail of their first
capture frame generated by motion.

To do this requires a couple of config lines in motion.conf to be edited.
output_normal first.

target_dir /var/www/media

jpeg_filename vthumb_%Y%m%d_%H%M%S

These allow motion to put a thumbnail into the media folder when triggered.
The new preview.php associates these with the corresponding recording.

Thumbnails are also generated for manually recorded images
and videos using ffmpeg. It can give a delay when going into the list if new material needs
to be thumbnailed, but after that it is faster.

Each row has an explicit preview and delete button and select checkboxes.
Select all, Select None and Delete selected, and Get Zip functions added.

Preview and thumbnail sizes can be changed per browser (cookies).

Tech changed from GET to POST and download moved into preview.php

1st March
Fixed broken download

2nd March
Added Schedule.php which provides a web page to set automation settings and a daemon to execute them.
To use the motion commands for start and end need to be 0 and 1 sent to schedule FIFOIN (/var/www/FIFO1)
Schedule will then send its configured commands to FIFOOUT (/var/www/FIFO)
Schedule needs to be started once on its settings page or can be arranged to autostart by adding a php schedule.php
command to boot.
